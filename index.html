                <h2>What's this all about?</h2>
                <p>I find too often that I get bored once I've tackled a task and look for ways to improve. One of the
                    many reasons why I chose to dive into web development is that there is always a new and exciting way
                    to make what I create better. Whether I'm refreshing my designs, organizing my code, or learning a
                    whole new technology I find that the limit to what can be done in web development is endless.</p>
                <p>I realized my interest in coding while taking electives in college. I found a database class that was
                    challenging but also gratifying. Since then I've always wanted to make that feeling my career. I
                    found that being able to make something was the feeling that made me happiest. My parents would
                    remind me of my childhood and putting LEGOs together and making the cool pictures on the box, but I
                    always remember trying to find cool and new ways to make something from what was in front of me.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="col" data-aos="fade-bottom">
            <h2>What Else I Enjoy Doing</h2>
            <p>Besides spending all day in front of the computer making the cool web apps I also have a deep passion for
                ice hockey. I've been playing competitive hockey for 20 years and I follow my favorite team, the Florida
                Panthers, all season long. I can frequently been found in my home office with the hockey game on looking
                over an online documentation and trying to make something work or looking into a new design.</p>
            <p>What drew me into hockey was the speed of the game and how difficult it is to master. Being able to skate
                on a 1/2" blade and move around on ice while making complex decisions about the game in the moment is
                beautiful. The physical and mental demands of the game are what give me the determination to go after
                new adventures and those long practices give me the patience to really perfect my crafts.</p>
            <p>Other than sports I also really enjoy music, video games, and movie marathons with my girlfriend and our
                adorable Shiba Inu Scarlet.</p>
